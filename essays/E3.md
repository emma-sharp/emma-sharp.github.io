## BrowserHistory6

The BrowserHistory6 WOD focused on the aspects of building a dynamic webpage. It was mainly a formatting exercise for the "History of Browsers" webpage that I created throughout the previous WODs. I used onmousover and onclick actions and attached links to other pages through the use of buttons. Here's the link for further details:

## My Experience 

This WOD took me two tries. On my first try, I ended up DNFing because I got tripped up with the correct syntax for onmousover and onclick actions. I think I had the quotes in all the wrong places, things were out of order, and I'm sure I forgot a semicolon at some point. My code wasn't looking how I needed it too, so I scratched my first go and started over.

On my second try, things went a lot better. I was able to really get the hang of efficiently using CSS, so writing everything took me a lot less time. It took me Av time, and it was really satisfying when I got all my buttons and images to work correctly.
