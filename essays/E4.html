  <h2 id="1-my-programming-skills-have-greatly-improved-in-the-following-ways">1. My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I’ve become more proficient in understanding JavaScript syntax and structure. For instance, I can now write functions and loops with greater ease, which was evident in my Assignment1 where I implemented several complex functionalities.</li>
  <li>My problem-solving skills have improved, especially in debugging. I used to struggle with tracing and fixing errors, but now I can identify and resolve issues more quickly.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-i-need-to-work-on-the-following-to-improve-my-programming-skills">2. I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I still find working through full projects without outside help challenging. I plan to focus more on this area by studying relevant materials and practicing with specific exercises.</li>
  <li>Enhancing my code efficiency is another area for improvement. I intend to learn more about algorithms and data structures to write more optimized code.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-i-have-learned-a-lot-from-doing-wods-and-i-can-do-them-without-copying-the-screencast">3. I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Initially, I relied heavily on screencasts, but over time, I’ve gained enough confidence to tackle WODs independently. A notable example was when I completed all of the most recent WODs without any external assistance.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="4-the-labs-have-helped-me-learn-and-i-am-able-to-complete-them-with-confidence">4. The labs have helped me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Labs have been instrumental in reinforcing my understanding of all the concepts. They provide a hands-on experience that complements the theoretical knowledge from lectures.</li>
  <li>I particularly enjoyed Lab 10, as it allowed me to apply multiple interesting JavaScript concepts in a practical context.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5-i-learned-a-lot-from-my-experience-doing-assignment-1-and-feel-ready-to-work-on-assignment-2">5. I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Assignment 1 was challenging yet rewarding. It required me to integrate various JavaScript elements, which deepened my understanding and application skills.</li>
  <li>The experience has equipped me with the necessary skills and confidence to take on Assignment 2, where I expect to build upon what I’ve learned and explore more complex problems.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="6-i-think-the-class-can-be-improved-to-help-my-learning-in-the-following-ways">6. I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>More interactive Q&amp;A sessions could be beneficial, allowing for real-time problem-solving and discussion.</li>
  <li>Incorporating peer review sessions might also help, as getting feedback from classmates can provide different perspectives and insights.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="7-what-helps-me-the-most-in-class-are-wods-labs-class-website-screencasts-readings-quizzes-one-on-one-help-working-with-classmates-etc">7. What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one-on-one help, working with classmates, etc.):</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I find the combination of screencasts and labs most helpful. Screencasts encourage independent learning while also offering much needed support, while labs provide a structured, guided learning environment.</li>
  <li>The class website is a great resource for reviewing materials, and the screencasts are helpful for understanding complex concepts.</li>
</ul>
