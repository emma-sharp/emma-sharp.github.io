  <h2 id="browserhistory6">BrowserHistory6</h2>

<p>The BrowserHistory6 WOD focused on the aspects of building a dynamic webpage. It was mainly a formatting exercise for the “History of Browsers” webpage that I created throughout the previous WODs. I used onmousover and onclick actions and attached links to other pages through the use of buttons. Here’s the link for further details: 
<a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/040.dynamic-web-pages/experience-browserhistory6.html">BrowserHistory6</a></p>

<h2 id="my-experience">My Experience</h2>

<p>This WOD took me two tries. On my first try, I ended up DNFing because I got tripped up with the correct syntax for onmousover and onclick actions. I think I had the quotes in all the wrong places, things were out of order, and I’m sure I forgot a semicolon at some point. My code wasn’t looking how I needed it too, so I scratched my first go and started over.</p>

<p>On my second try, things went a lot better. I was able to really get the hang of efficiently using CSS, so writing everything took me a lot less time. It took me Av time, and it was really satisfying when I got all my buttons and images to work correctly.</p>

<p>To prepare, I looked over the Dynamic Web Page module readings again, and I also went through the most recent lab that we worked on in class. I definitely spent more time in preparation for this WOD than I did on previous WODs. This is because during previous WODs, I often found myself getting tripped up on things that I knew I had seen before, and I ended up wasting time having to go back and look at my notes. By reading over the notes ahead of time, I was able to save time during the WOD once the timer started counting down.</p>

<h2 id="for-next-time">For Next Time</h2>

<p>To be better prepared, I could have dedicated more time to reading over each instruction for the WOD and ensuring that I knew what the question was asking me to do. For WODs going forward, I think I will structure my preparation routine like this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Read over each instruction diligently</li>
  <li>Take note of any concept I am not sure about</li>
  <li>Then go back and find examples in my notes, readings, and/or labs of how to complete the tasks I’m not confident about</li>
</ol>
