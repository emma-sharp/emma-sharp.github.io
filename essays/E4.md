## 1. My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
   - I've become more proficient in understanding JavaScript syntax and structure. For instance, I can now write functions and loops with greater ease, which was evident in my Assignment1 where I implemented several complex functionalities.
   - My problem-solving skills have improved, especially in debugging. I used to struggle with tracing and fixing errors, but now I can identify and resolve issues more quickly.

## 2. I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
   - I still find working through full projects without outside help challenging. I plan to focus more on this area by studying relevant materials and practicing with specific exercises.
   - Enhancing my code efficiency is another area for improvement. I intend to learn more about algorithms and data structures to write more optimized code.

## 3. I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:
   - Initially, I relied heavily on screencasts, but over time, I've gained enough confidence to tackle WODs independently. A notable example was when I completed all of the most recent WODs without any external assistance.

## 4. The labs have helped me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:
   - Labs have been instrumental in reinforcing my understanding of all the concepts. They provide a hands-on experience that complements the theoretical knowledge from lectures.
   - I particularly enjoyed Lab 10, as it allowed me to apply multiple interesting JavaScript concepts in a practical context.

## 5. I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:
   - Assignment 1 was challenging yet rewarding. It required me to integrate various JavaScript elements, which deepened my understanding and application skills.
   - The experience has equipped me with the necessary skills and confidence to take on Assignment 2, where I expect to build upon what I've learned and explore more complex problems.

## 6. I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
   - More interactive Q&A sessions could be beneficial, allowing for real-time problem-solving and discussion.
   - Incorporating peer review sessions might also help, as getting feedback from classmates can provide different perspectives and insights.

## 7. What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one-on-one help, working with classmates, etc.):
   - I find the combination of screencasts and labs most helpful. Screencasts encourage independent learning while also offering much needed support, while labs provide a structured, guided learning environment.
   - The class website is a great resource for reviewing materials, and the screencasts are helpful for understanding complex concepts.
