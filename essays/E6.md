### Brief Description of the System
For Assignment 3, I developed an e-commerce website for a surf shop. The site featured an extensive catalog of surf-related products, including boards, apparel, and accessories. The website offered functionalities like user registration, login, a shopping cart, and an invoice generation system.

### Notable Shortcomings or Bugs
One notable shortcoming was that there were occasional bugs in the shopping cart update mechanism when multiple items were added simultaneously.

### Most Proud Aspect of the System
I am most proud of the user-friendly interface and the seamless navigation between different product pages. The checkout process is intuitive and the automated invoice email feature works flawlessly.

### Least Happy Aspect of the System
I am least happy with the website's performance optimization. Under heavy load, response times increase, affecting the user experience.

### Difference from Assignment #2
Developing Assignment 3 was much more complex than Assignment 2, mainly due to the integration of advanced features like session management and a dynamic shopping cart. It required deeper knowledge of backend programming and a more sophisticated approach to data handling.

### Addressing Problems
Whenever I encountered a problem, such as a bug in the cart system, I first tried to debug it myself using console logs and breakpoints. If stuck, I referred to online forums or documentation for guidance.

### What Worked Well
Planning and structuring the project upfront worked well. This approach helped in managing the workload effectively and in maintaining a consistent design across the website.

### What Didn’t Work Well
What didn’t work well was underestimating the time required for testing and debugging. This led to some rushed work in the final stages of the project.

### Learnings from the Assignment
I learned the importance of thorough planning, especially for a complex project. I also gained a much deeper understanding of web technologies like Node.js, Express, and session management.

### Changes if Done Differently
If I could go back, I would allocate more time for testing and perhaps simplify some features to ensure smoother operation under load.

## Estimated Time Spent
Thinking & Planning: 20%
Writing Code: 50%
Testing and Debugging: 30%
