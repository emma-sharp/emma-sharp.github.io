## BrowserHistory6

The BrowserHistory6 WOD focused on the aspects of building a dynamic webpage. It was mainly a formatting exercise for the "History of Browsers" webpage that I created throughout the previous WODs. I used onmousover actions and attached links to other pages through the use of buttons.
