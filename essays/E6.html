  <h3 id="brief-description-of-the-system">Brief Description of the System</h3>
<p>For Assignment 3, I developed an e-commerce website for a surf shop. The site featured an extensive catalog of surf-related products, including boards, apparel, and accessories. The website offered functionalities like user registration, login, a shopping cart, and an invoice generation system.</p>

<h3 id="notable-shortcomings-or-bugs">Notable Shortcomings or Bugs</h3>
<p>One notable shortcoming was that there were occasional bugs in the shopping cart update mechanism when multiple items were added simultaneously.</p>

<h3 id="most-proud-aspect-of-the-system">Most Proud Aspect of the System</h3>
<p>I am most proud of the user-friendly interface and the seamless navigation between different product pages. The checkout process is intuitive and the automated invoice email feature works flawlessly.</p>

<h3 id="least-happy-aspect-of-the-system">Least Happy Aspect of the System</h3>
<p>I am least happy with the website’s performance optimization. Under heavy load, response times increase, affecting the user experience.</p>

<h3 id="difference-from-assignment-2">Difference from Assignment #2</h3>
<p>Developing Assignment 3 was much more complex than Assignment 2, mainly due to the integration of advanced features like session management and a dynamic shopping cart. It required deeper knowledge of backend programming and a more sophisticated approach to data handling.</p>

<h3 id="addressing-problems">Addressing Problems</h3>
<p>Whenever I encountered a problem, such as a bug in the cart system, I first tried to debug it myself using console logs and breakpoints. If stuck, I referred to online forums or documentation for guidance.</p>

<h3 id="what-worked-well">What Worked Well</h3>
<p>Planning and structuring the project upfront worked well. This approach helped in managing the workload effectively and in maintaining a consistent design across the website.</p>

<h3 id="what-didnt-work-well">What Didn’t Work Well</h3>
<p>What didn’t work well was underestimating the time required for testing and debugging. This led to some rushed work in the final stages of the project.</p>

<h3 id="learnings-from-the-assignment">Learnings from the Assignment</h3>
<p>I learned the importance of thorough planning, especially for a complex project. I also gained a much deeper understanding of web technologies like Node.js, Express, and session management.</p>

<h3 id="changes-if-done-differently">Changes if Done Differently</h3>
<p>If I could go back, I would allocate more time for testing and perhaps simplify some features to ensure smoother operation under load.</p>

<h2 id="estimated-time-spent">Estimated Time Spent</h2>
<p>Thinking &amp; Planning: 20%
Writing Code: 50%
Testing and Debugging: 30%</p>
