## My first 3 WODs

BrowserHistory WODs 1,2 and 3 went... ok for me. I felt pretty confident heading into BrowserHistory1, and I completed it on my first try in Sd time. Being honest, I did have to use some help from my notes and from ChatGPT when it came to inserting and formatting the logo images correctly. I think I could have figured it out on my own, but I was worried about the time running out. After I finished, I went back and watched the demonstration video to see where I could have been more efficient. Turns out, there were a couple of instances where I could have cut down my code and achieved the same result. Overall, I gained a lot of confidence with running servers and using the basic HTML tags. 

My first attempt at BrowserHistory2 was going super well, until I hit the last instruction. Actually, maybe it wasn't going super well, but it was going enough for me to finish on time. I ended up DNFing because I could not figure out how to put the logos inline with the text the way that the example had. I went back and watched the demonstration video to see the solution to where I got stuck.
